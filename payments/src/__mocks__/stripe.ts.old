export const stripe = {

    // promise with a test payment intent ID, Why are returning a resolved promise?
    // Because the actual Stripe API call is asynchronous, and we want to simulate that behavior in our tests.
    // By using jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(), we can ensure that when the create method is called in our tests,
    // it will return a promise that resolves to the specified value (in this case, an object with an id property).
    // This allows us to test our code without making real API calls to Stripe, which can be slow and may have side effects.
